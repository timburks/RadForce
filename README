RadForce contains a new simplified SDK for interacting with the 
Salesforce platform from Mac and iOS apps.

Released under the Apache 2 license.

Copyright 2014, Radtastical Inc. All rights reserved.

USAGE: The GoNative Xcode project contains two targets: "Browser"
and "KeyRing". The Browser app can be used to browse, view, and
modify data stored on the Salesforce platform. The KeyRing app
demonstrates in-app OAuth authentication and together the two 
apps illustrate three methods of authentication.

1) Direct authentication by sending a Salesforce username, 
password, and security token to a Salesforce API.

2) Indirect authentication by performing OAuth in an iOS app.

3) Indirect authentication by performing OAuth in mobile
Safari (iOS).

The essential SDK is in Common/Salesforce/SFConnection.h.
It contains a dozen or so methods that return NSMutableURLRequest
objects that perform important operations on the Salesforce
platform including creating, fetching, updating, and deleting
objects, managing binary objects as Document instances, and
introspecting the database to obtain lists of available
entities and field types.

IMPORTANT: In several places, it is necessary to enter the consumer
key, consumer secret, and other user credentials (including a Salesforce
username, password, and security token) to use all of the demonstrated
features.
